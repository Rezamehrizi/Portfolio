abstract: In this article, we consider the prediction of future failure times based on Type-I hybrid censored samples. Point predictors and prediction intervals using different procedures are discussed for a general model. The exponential and Rayleigh distributions are used as illustrative examples to show the most simplified forms of the so obtained predictors as well as prediction intervals. Intensive simulation study and a real life dataset are presented to illustrate our findings and results.
