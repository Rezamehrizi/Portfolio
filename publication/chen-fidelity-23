abstract: This paper proposes a framework for evaluating and modeling perception systems, motivated by the need to develop testing scenarios for verification and validation of autonomous driving systems operating in various driving environment perception approaches, including both ego-vehicle centric perception and cooperative perception with enabled connectivity. The proposed perception system evaluation and modeling approach is probabilistic, with perception failures and errors encoded as stochastic processes and accounts for the operation domain. The perception error model is parameterized to consider both spatial and temporal aspects in the offline evaluation process. The proposed method exhibits well-fitting performance on the model of the perception error pattern based on evaluation results in various virtual and real traffic data with several benchmark perception algorithms.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper addresses challenges in testing Automated Driving System (ADS) functions, proposing a novel medium-fidelity evaluation and modeling approach. It aims to scale testing processes and improve test case interpretability, given the complexity of ADS setups. The proposed framework uses a statistical model to handle uncertainty and errors in perception systems, encoding error propagation in space and time. Operating conditions, including hardware, software configurations, and safety parameters, are described and evaluated with real-world and simulated data. The paper offers a promising solution for effective ADS testing and continual learning.
